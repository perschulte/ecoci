## Context

EcoCI requires a robust DevOps infrastructure to support its microservices architecture and provide reliable staging and production environments. Key requirements include:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for reproducible and version-controlled infrastructure
- Cloud-native deployment on AWS for scalability and managed services
- Kubernetes orchestration for microservices management
- CI/CD pipelines for automated building, testing, and deployment
- Cost-effective staging environment for development and testing
- Security best practices including workload identity and TLS certificates
- Monitoring and observability integration readiness

Technology forces in tension:
- Cost vs. features (managed services vs. self-hosted)
- Complexity vs. maintainability
- Security vs. ease of use
- Development velocity vs. operational stability

## Decision

We will implement the following infrastructure stack:

**Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- Industry standard with excellent AWS provider support
- Strong state management and plan/apply workflow
- Modular design supporting reusable components
- Well-documented and widely adopted

**Cloud Provider**: AWS
- Comprehensive managed services ecosystem
- EKS for Kubernetes with minimal operational overhead
- Route53 for DNS management
- ACM for TLS certificate automation
- Strong security and compliance features

**Container Orchestration**: Amazon EKS
- Managed Kubernetes service reducing operational burden
- Built-in security and compliance features
- Seamless integration with AWS services
- Cost-effective for small to medium workloads

**CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions
- Native integration with GitHub repository
- OIDC workload identity for secure AWS access
- Rich ecosystem of community actions
- No additional tooling costs

**Networking and Security**:
- Custom VPC with public/private subnet architecture
- Security groups following least-privilege principles
- ACM certificates for TLS termination
- OIDC-based authentication eliminating long-lived secrets

**Staging Environment Architecture**:
- Single-node EKS cluster (t3.medium) for cost optimization
- Shared ALB for ingress routing
- Route53 subdomain (stg.ecoci.dev) for service access
- CloudWatch integration for basic monitoring

## Consequences

### Positive

- Reproducible infrastructure through Terraform modules
- Reduced operational overhead with managed AWS services
- Strong security posture with OIDC and least-privilege access
- Cost-effective staging environment suitable for development
- Industry-standard tooling with strong community support
- Clear separation of concerns between infrastructure and application code
- Built-in disaster recovery through infrastructure code
- Seamless integration between AWS services

### Negative

- AWS vendor lock-in limiting multi-cloud strategies
- Terraform state management adds complexity
- EKS minimum costs even for small workloads
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Kubernetes
- Additional complexity in CI/CD pipeline setup
- Potential for configuration drift if not properly managed

### Neutral

- Monthly AWS costs predictable but ongoing
- Requires AWS expertise for troubleshooting
- Terraform modules need maintenance and updates
- CI/CD pipelines need ongoing optimization
- Security configurations require regular review
